HCI-FITS
========

Module for the creation of high-level science products (HLSP) in the HCI-FITS format, a dedicated format for the results of high-contrast imaging (HCI) observations and surveys.

The specification of the HCI-FITS format for high-contrast imaging was proposed by the `ALICE <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/alice/>`_ project. The goal of this format is to simplify HLSP exchange in the HCI community by adopting a standard output format for all the usual data products. The format is based on a single multi-extension FITS file (`Pence et al.2010 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...524A..42P>`_) that gathers all the high-level information about the datasets, which we call HCI-FITS file for High-Contrast Imaging FITS file. 

A full description of the format specifications is available in `Hagan et al. (2018) <https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/hlsp/alice/hlsp_alice_hst_nicmos_all_multi_v1_readme.pdf>`_.
